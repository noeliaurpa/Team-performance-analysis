# Team performance analysis
The objective of this project is to analyze and monitor the operational performance of development teams using key software delivery metrics. 

It aims to evaluate team velocity based on the story points completed over the last sprints, as well as adherence to documentation delivery processes related to production deployments. Specifically, it examines whether teams are delivering release notes and SES documents within the established time windows (12 and 24 hours before deployment, respectively), for both CRA and Codebase projects. 

This analysis will help identify improvement opportunities in time management and the quality of the continuous delivery process.
